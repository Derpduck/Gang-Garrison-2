/*
BUGS:
=Replays don't work (don't play back) Really want to fix this soon.
^The player dont seem to be written on the first lines unlike a working replay from gem.
-Even when that does happen it still gives a "wrong number of players" error when attemping to watch one.

=If the console is open in the ingame menu, trying to chat will open the console as well, preventing chatting

=Client disconnect message does not show in console.
Only shows for clients.
