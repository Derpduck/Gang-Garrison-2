/*
BUGS:
-1- Replays don't work (don't play back) Really want to fix this, will not release until then.

^The player dont seem to be written on the first lines unlike a working replay from gem.
-Even when that does happen it still gives a "wrong number of players" error when attemping to watch one.

-2- Certain HUD elements that I've added move around when others exists
-+- (e.g. hp text when scoreboard is open) -FIXED-

-3- If the console is open in the ingame menu, trying to chat will open the console as well, preventing chatting

-4- When other menus (maybe chat) are open, the title on the console can be offset (probably a halign issue) -FIXED-

-5- Client disconnect message does not show in console.
